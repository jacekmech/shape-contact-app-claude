# update implementation plan

## Purpose
Apply relevant ready updates from the PRD and/or Technical Concept to the Implementation Plan so that execution stays aligned with effective upstream changes without rewriting closed work or blurring execution boundaries.

## When to Use
Use this skill when the user wants to propagate ready specification updates into execution planning, add new slices required by ready updates, or adjust open slices before the affected work has started.

Typical triggers:
- “update implementation plan”
- “propagate this ready update into the plan”
- “reflect the new design update in execution planning”
- “adjust the plan for this approved spec change”
- “add slices for the ready update”

## Inputs
Expected inputs:
- active feature reference or resolved feature folder
- ready Implementation Plan in `03-implementation-plan.md`
- one or more ready updates in `01-prd.md` and/or `02-tech-concept.md`

Helpful but optional:
- the specific ready update to propagate
- known affected slices
- implementation constraints already discovered during execution

## Preconditions
Before updating the Implementation Plan:
- resolve the active feature and locate `01-prd.md`, `02-tech-concept.md`, and `03-implementation-plan.md`
- inspect ready updates in the PRD and Technical Concept that materially affect execution
- inspect current plan status and slice state
- identify whether the affected work is still open, already in progress, or already closed

This skill should only propagate effective upstream changes.
Draft specification updates should not be treated as execution truth.

## Behavior
Update the Implementation Plan inline to reflect ready upstream changes.

When a ready update changes execution shape:
- add new slices if new work is required
- adjust existing open slices when their scope or ordering must change
- keep the execution model small, explicit, and reviewable

Respect Shape’s execution boundaries:
- closed slices should not be rewritten
- in-progress slices should not be reshaped in ways that invalidate active execution
- implementation tasks should not be rewritten by this skill
- downstream propagation should remain explicit rather than implied

If a ready update affects work that has already started:
- surface the conflict clearly
- prefer adding new slices or notes that account for the changed direction
- avoid silently reinterpreting already executed or active work

The responsible role remains the Developer.
The agent may propose execution reshaping, but should not silently decide how to absorb significant trade-offs without developer confirmation.

## Artifact Rules
Read the ready PRD and Technical Concept updates as upstream inputs.
Update only the Implementation Plan in `03-implementation-plan.md`.

Work against these sections:
- `## Slices`
- `## Execution Order`
- `## Relevant Files`
- `## Notes`

Apply these rules:
- the Implementation Plan is updated inline rather than through append-only updates
- only ready PRD or Technical Concept updates are effective for propagation
- new slices may be appended during implementation
- only open slices may be updated
- in-progress slices, closed slices, and any Implementation Tasks must not be rewritten by this skill
- `## Relevant Files` may be refreshed when upcoming execution areas changed

This skill may:
- append new slices
- update existing open slice descriptions
- adjust execution order for work that has not started
- refresh `## Relevant Files` to reflect upcoming execution reality
- add clarifying notes when propagation creates constraints or sequencing implications

This skill must not:
- modify Implementation Tasks under `## Execution Order`
- mark slices or tasks done
- rewrite closed or in-progress slices as if no work has happened
- treat draft upstream updates as effective

## Outputs
This skill should produce:
- an updated Implementation Plan aligned to ready upstream changes
- any new or revised open slices needed for execution
- surfaced warnings when propagation is constrained by in-progress or completed work
- a clear likely next step

## Completion Signals
This skill is complete when:
- the Implementation Plan reflects the relevant ready upstream changes
- any new work is visible through slices rather than implied in prose alone
- protected boundaries around in-progress work, closed work, and tasks were preserved
- any propagation constraints are surfaced clearly
- the next likely workflow action is stated plainly

## Guardrails
- Do not propagate draft PRD or Technical Concept updates as if they were effective
- Do not rewrite Implementation Tasks through this skill
- Do not silently reinterpret closed or in-progress slices
- Do not use `## Relevant Files` as a substitute for actual slice updates when execution shape changed
- Do not hide conflicts between ready updates and already-started work

## Likely Next Step
Usually suggest one of:
- `prepare slice` if the updated plan now has a clear next open slice
- continue `update implementation plan` if propagation impact is still being resolved
- `update technical concept` or `update prd` if the upstream change is still incomplete

Prefer `prepare slice` once the updated plan has a clear next slice ready for refinement.
