## Shape workflow

This repository uses the Shape workflow for AI-assisted software delivery.

Shape is a step-by-step workflow with explicit approval boundaries.

When working in this repository:

- Follow the default Shape step order unless the user explicitly asks for another supported Shape operation.
- Treat each Shape operation as a separate boundary.
- Do not move to the next Shape operation without explicit user approval.
- Do not silently combine multiple Shape operations into one step.
- After a Shape operation updates workflow artifacts, stop and let the user review and commit the result, or explicitly ask you to commit it.
- `implement batch` is the special exception: it ends with code and any resulting Implementation Plan updates ready for review, not approved, not committed.
- Review, marking tasks done, and commit are handled by the later explicit Shape steps.

Default Shape step order:
1. initiate feature
2. create prd
3. create technical concept
4. initiate implementation
5. prepare slice
6. implement batch
7. review batch
8. commit batch
9. finish slice
10. finish implementation

Before acting:

- Read `.shape/config.json` to understand the configured Shape feature root and canonical artifact filenames.
- Treat `.shape/workspace.json` as transient local workspace state. Do not rely on it as committed project state.
- Use `.shape/workflow-templates/` as the canonical source for workflow artifact templates.
- Treat feature folders under the configured feature root as the primary Shape delivery units.
- Use installed Claude Code skills from `.claude/skills/` when a matching Shape workflow operation applies.

Shape feature artifacts typically include:
- `01-prd.md`
- `02-tech-concept.md`
- `03-implementation-plan.md`

Do not invent alternative artifact naming or layout if the configured Shape files already exist.
