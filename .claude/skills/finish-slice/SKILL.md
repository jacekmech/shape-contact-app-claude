# finish slice

## Purpose
Validate a completed slice and mark it as done in the Implementation Plan once its tasks are completed, approved, and committed.

## When to Use
Use this skill when the user wants to close a slice whose tasks are completed, confirm that the slice objective was actually met, or mark the slice done in the Implementation Plan after its approved batches have been committed.

Typical triggers:
- “finish slice”
- “close this slice”
- “mark the slice done”
- “validate the completed slice”
- “is this slice ready to close?”

## Inputs
Expected inputs:
- active feature reference or resolved feature folder
- active slice or selected slice in `03-implementation-plan.md`
- completed and committed work for that slice

Helpful but optional:
- specific slice objective to validate against
- recent implementation decisions that affect slice closure
- known follow-up work for the next slice

## Preconditions
Before finishing a slice:
- resolve the active feature and locate `03-implementation-plan.md`
- identify the selected slice, defaulting to the active open slice when the context is clear
- verify that the slice tasks are completed
- verify that any approved batches for the slice have already been committed
- inspect whether the slice objective appears satisfied

This skill should close only validated slices.
If tasks remain open or approved work is still uncommitted, surface that clearly instead of marking the slice done.

## Behavior
Validate the selected slice against its intended objective and task completion state.

During slice validation:
- confirm the slice objective is actually met
- confirm the task list reflects completed approved work
- surface any remaining gap instead of forcing closure
- keep the slice boundary explicit so the next slice starts from a clean state

If slice completion changes what future work should focus on:
- refresh `## Relevant Files` to keep fresh-session pickup useful
- keep the section selective and forward-looking rather than historical

The responsible role remains the Developer.
The agent may help validate and update the plan, but should not silently close a slice that still has unresolved work or uncommitted approved changes.

## Artifact Rules
Update only the Implementation Plan in `03-implementation-plan.md`.

Work against these sections:
- `## Slices`
- `## Execution Order`
- `## Relevant Files`
- `## Notes`

Apply these rules:
- slice completion happens only after its tasks are completed and approved batches are committed
- the slice checkbox in `## Slices` should reflect validated completion
- the corresponding slice line in `## Execution Order` should already reflect completed tasks before closure
- `## Relevant Files` may be pruned or refreshed when slice completion changes what is useful for subsequent slices

This skill may:
- mark the selected slice done in `## Slices`
- ensure slice state is reflected consistently in the Implementation Plan
- refresh `## Relevant Files` for upcoming execution
- add a short note when it clarifies what the next slice should pick up

This skill must not:
- mark a slice done while tasks are still open
- close a slice before approved batches are committed
- use slice closure to hide incomplete work
- mark the whole implementation done unless all slices are complete

## Outputs
This skill should produce:
- a validated slice marked as done in the Implementation Plan
- any helpful `## Relevant Files` or note updates for the next slice
- a clear likely next step

## Completion Signals
This skill is complete when:
- the selected slice is validated against its objective
- the slice is marked done only after task completion and commit boundaries are satisfied
- the Implementation Plan reflects the closed slice clearly
- the next likely workflow action is stated plainly

## Guardrails
- Do not close a slice with open tasks
- Do not close a slice before approved work is committed
- Do not use slice closure as a shortcut for unresolved review or approval state
- Do not leave the next execution step implicit once a slice is closed
- Do not mark implementation done unless all slices are completed and validated

## Likely Next Step
Usually suggest one of:
- `prepare slice` for the next open slice
- `finish implementation` if all slices are now completed and validated
- `update implementation plan` if slice completion exposed a needed execution reshaping

Prefer `prepare slice` when more slices remain and the next one is ready to refine.
